this code integrates the eqn 2 phi,ur - phi,rr = 0
in u,r coords defined as u=t-x and r = x
it also implements boundary conditions so that the field
stays in the comp box
these bc. are phi=0 at left boundary
and g with value such that phi results 0 at the boundary.
the former is trivially done in the integration of the first order
variable g = phi,r
while the latter right after each RK step is finished, thus overwritting
the values of g and phi at the last point
