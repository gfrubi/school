Here is the list of routines in the code
and compilation instructions.

This code integrates the scalar field equation on 
a fixed BH background in spherical symmetry. It employs
ingoing Eddington Finkelstein coordinates and excises the black hole.

Makefile.  script to compile the code, simply
type "make" and the code should compile itself.

main.f90 -- this is the main driver of the code.
it defines the needed variables (actully allocates even more
than needed!). it sets u(1) = phi; u(2) = phi,r ; u(3) = pi

params.f90 -- define vars for the parameters and 
	      the routine to read them from pars.in

initial.f90 -- defines the initial data. Called by main.f90

evol.f90 -- performs a single step evolution with Runge-Kutta
	    3rd order. Called by main.f90
	    it needs to call derivs (to compute first order spatial derivatives)
	    dissipation (to compute the dissipation operator)
	    rhs (to evaluate the rhs of each eqn)
	    boundary (to impose boundary conditions)

derivs.f90 -- defines routines to calculate derivatives and
	      has a dissipation operator

boundary.f90 -- defines the boundary condition at the right hand
		side level. 3 options are specified, as a model

rhs.f90 -- rhs, this code integrates the scalar field eqn on a fixed BH background


THe code will produce output to be viewed with xvs.
creates *.sdf files which are then supposed to be sent
to xvs with the command "sdftoxvs file.sdf"
having opened xvs first
